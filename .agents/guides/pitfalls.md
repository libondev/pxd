### Scheduled shallowRef refresh misses in-place prop mutations

- **Symptom**: A heavy computed result moved to `shallowRef` stops updating when callers mutate array/object props in place.
- **Cause**: Watching the raw prop reference only tracks replacement, while the original computed chain tracked nested reads made while building derived data.
- **Fix**: Watch the computed dependencies that still read the prop contents, then schedule the heavy `shallowRef` refresh from those dependencies.

### RAF throttling does not isolate synchronous consumer work

- **Symptom**: A continuously controlled component still drops frames after pointer updates are throttled with `requestAnimationFrame`.
- **Cause**: Each frame synchronously emits both the live model update and the committed change event, so consumer listeners remain in the rendering hot path.
- **Fix**: Emit only `update:modelValue` during interaction, then synchronously process the final pointer position and emit `change` once when the interaction commits.

### Slot children may be wrapped in Fragments

- **Symptom**: Reordering top-level slot VNodes does not reorder items rendered by a template `v-for`.
- **Cause**: Vue can wrap the generated VNodes in a `Fragment`, leaving only one top-level slot child.
- **Fix**: Recursively flatten `Fragment` children at the owning slot boundary before applying order-dependent behavior.

### Deep selectors require scoped styles

- **Symptom**: A parent state class updates, but descendant component layout rules never take effect.
- **Cause**: Vue's `:deep()` transform only applies to scoped style blocks; in a regular `<style>` block the browser receives an unsupported selector.
- **Fix**: Use ordinary descendant selectors in global component styles, or add `scoped` when the rules require `:deep()`.
